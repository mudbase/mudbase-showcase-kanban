# Mudbase Showcase — Kanban

A team task board (Kanban) built **entirely on [Mudbase](https://www.mudbase.dev)** — auth,
database, and realtime — with **zero custom backend**. The same app, reimplemented once per
official Mudbase SDK, so every supported language has a real, runnable reference app rather than
a toy snippet.

Every version talks to the same Mudbase project shape (see `web/plan/build-plan.md` for the
collection/permission schema) and demonstrates the same feature set: multi-role RBAC (owner /
member / viewer), a board with lists (columns) and cards, drag-style card movement between lists,
and a realtime activity log.

clone this repo and only set up the language you care about.

## Prerequisite: clone the SDK repo as a sibling

Most versions here (everything except `python/`, `go/`, and `ruby/`, whose package managers can
install straight from a git subdirectory) reference the [mudbase-sdk](https://github.com/mudbase/mudbase-sdk)
repo by relative path, since none of the 9 SDKs are published to a public registry yet. Clone it
next to this repo, at the same parent directory level, before building any version besides `web/`:

```
some-folder/
├── mudbase-sdk/                 # git clone https://github.com/mudbase/mudbase-sdk
└── mudbase-showcase-kanban/     # this repo
```

## Data model & roles

Three collections on a single Mudbase project, plus three multi-role roles:

- **lists** — `boardId`, `name`, `position` (a single shared board — `boardId` is a constant)
- **cards** — `boardId`, `listId`, `title`, `description?`, `position`, `assigneeId?`,
  `assigneeName?`, `createdById`, `createdByName`
- **activity** — `boardId`, `actorId`, `actorName`, `action`, `cardTitle?`, `fromList?`, `toList?`

Roles: **owner** (full CRUD everywhere), **member** (read lists, full CRUD cards, log activity),
**viewer** (read-only everywhere — no writes at all). Auth, users, and realtime are all native
Mudbase features — no separate user table.
