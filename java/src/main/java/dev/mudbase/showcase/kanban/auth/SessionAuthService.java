 * token in scope).
 *
 * <p>Ported from {@code mudbase-showcase-ecommerce/java}'s {@code SessionAuthService}, including
 * the already-fixed {@link #recoverFromUnauthorized} - reused verbatim rather than rediscovered,
 * per the task's explicit instruction. This app's own {@code BoardController} (which resolves the
 * board's lists and cards in two sequential {@link
 * dev.mudbase.showcase.kanban.mudbase.MudbaseDataClient} calls from one session snapshot, then a
 * third for the activity feed on a nav click) is exactly the shape that bug required: see that
 * method's javadoc for the full bug/fix history.

  /**
   * Recovers from a 401 on an ordinary data/collection call by exchanging the stored refresh
   * token for a new access token, once. Called by {@link
   * dev.mudbase.showcase.kanban.mudbase.MudbaseDataClient} when a request bearing {@code
   * failedToken} comes back unauthorized.
   *
   * <p><b>Why a token mismatch does not mean "nothing to do."</b> This is the fix the sibling
   * {@code mudbase-showcase-ecommerce/java} port discovered and applied - reused here verbatim
   * rather than rediscovered, per the task's explicit instruction. Several call sites in this app
   * (most notably {@code BoardController#board}, which reads the signed-in {@link AuthSession}
   * once and passes that same snapshot's access token into a lists call and a cards call back to
   * back) read the session once and reuse its token across multiple {@link
   * dev.mudbase.showcase.kanban.mudbase.MudbaseDataClient} calls. If the token was expired, the
   * *first* of those calls lands here, refreshes, and updates the session - but the *second* call
   * still carries the pre-refresh token, so it 401s too and lands here again with a {@code
   * failedToken} that no longer matches {@code current.getToken()} (the first call already moved
   * it forward). Treating that as "someone else already fixed it, give up" discards a perfectly
   * good, just-refreshed session and forces a spurious "session expired" logout on every
   * multi-call page for any viewer whose access token happened to expire mid-request. The correct
   * read of a mismatch is the opposite: the session already holds a token newer than the one that
   * failed, so hand that back for an immediate retry instead of refreshing again. If it turns out
   * to *also* be stale (a real concurrent-request race, or the mismatch reflects a session some
   * other tab already logged out of), the retry simply fails with its own 401 and propagates
   * normally - this never masks a genuine failure, it only avoids inventing one.
   *
   * <p>Returns empty (no retry attempted) only when there is truly nothing left to recover with:
   * no session at all, the token that failed is still the one on file but there is no refresh
   * token to exchange it with, or the refresh call itself was rejected (refresh token
   * invalid/expired/already reused) - the caller is expected to treat the original 401 as final
   * in those cases.
