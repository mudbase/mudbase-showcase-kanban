module Mudbase
  # Builds a fresh, request-scoped set of generated `MudbaseSDK::*Api` instances. Ported
  # verbatim from the sibling `mudbase-showcase-social`/`mudbase-showcase-ecommerce` ports - see
  # those files' header comments for the full rationale (process-wide singleton race avoidance).
  #
  # `MudbaseSDK::Configuration.default` / `MudbaseSDK::ApiClient.default` are process-wide
  # singletons - every generated API class defaults to them. Calling the documented
  # `MudbaseSDK.configure { |c| c.access_token = jwt }` per request would mutate that shared
  # singleton, a real race condition in a multi-threaded Puma server: request A could read
  # request B's bearer token if both configure the global default concurrently. Instead, every
  # call site in this app builds its own `Configuration.new` + `ApiClient.new(config)` and hands
  # the resulting api_client explicitly into `AuthenticationApi.new(api_client)` /
  # `DataApi.new(api_client)` - fully isolated per request, no shared mutable state.

    # only declare `_id`/`created_at`/`updated_at` (Collections are a dynamic per-project schema
    # the generator can't type) - every real field (`boardId`, `title`, `position`, ...) would
